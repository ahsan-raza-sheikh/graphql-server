2.	Visual Studio Code. Please download from here https://code.visualstudio.com/download (or any other code editor of your choice)
3.	Postman (either Web or Desktop version). Please download from here the desktop version https://www.postman.com/downloads/
4.	Download or clone the base project from GitHub

Lab code setup:
1.	Download or clone the base project on your system.
2.	Run command "npm install" on the root of the sample project (where 'package.json' file is placed)
